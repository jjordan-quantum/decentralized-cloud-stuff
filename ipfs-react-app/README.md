# IPFS React App

Install deps with:

```shell
npm i
```

A single line was added to the `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "homepage": "."
}
```

Try running your app locally with:

```shell
npm start
```

Build the application with:

```shell
npm run build
```

Upload the `build` folder to IPFS. Voila - the resulting CID is the react app hosted on IPFS.
