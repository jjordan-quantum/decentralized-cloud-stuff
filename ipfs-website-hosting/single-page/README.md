# Hosting a Singe Page on IPFS

0. Change the contents of the `author` `meta` tag so that the file gets unique hash (CID)
1. Upload `index.html` to IPFS
2. Get 'SHARE' link (CID)
3. Paste link into browser -> website should load
4. Pin CID either on local IPFS desktop or pinning service (works much better - resolves faster)
